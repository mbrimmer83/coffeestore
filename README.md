## Project Overview
The goal of the project was to have a recurring order coffee store that would allow users to signup and login to place orders.
After login the user would be shown option packages to select from and the chosen package would be save to a cookie and then 
user would move on to the check out screen where they could provide shipping information. The user information would be stored
in a database as well as previous orders. A payment process was then given using Stripe. This can be tested on the live demo 
using the test credit card that is provided. Full routing, display messages, and prompt were instituted.

## Learning Outcomes
This project encompassed alot the skill that I had learned through the first 10 week of the program. A number of new Angular.js
concepts like $cookies and promises were used during the project. Encryption was used to encrypt passwords before storing them in
the database. MongoDB was used to store all the user info and I learned a great deal about database and structure. I learned to 
implement a number of new Node.js modules like Stripe, my-bcrypt, and Cors for this project. I also made large strides in my design
and user experience skills. This was also one of my favorite projects that I have worked on to date.
